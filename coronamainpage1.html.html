<h2>Digital technology and COVID-19</h2>

<p>any of us take for granted the modern digital technologies that</p>
<p> we did not have access to even a few decades ago. Some people, however,</p> 
<p>are very critical of these devices and services, arguing that they steal</p>
<p>everything from our jobs and privacy to our very humanity. But these</p>
<p> technological innovations, long characterized as trivial, nonessential</p>
 <p>or even harmful during times of calm and abundance, have now become </p>
 <p>indispensable in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, consider</p>
<p> how important the following technologies have become in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Broadband connections</p>
<p>Social distancing is essential to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p> With this in mind,  businesses, government bodies, and organizations </p>
<p> across the country have been going remote to help avoid some of the worst</p>
 <p>possible health consequences. Modern broadband connections allow staff to</p>
 <p>work at home instead of the office, greatly reducing the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Not only are people able to talk, message, and videoconference over the </p>
<p>internet as a result of this incredible digital infrastructure system, </p>
<p>for many professions, they are able to do just about anything they can do in a regular office.</p>
 <p>Widespread adoption of the internet and web applications have made it easier than ever to do</p>
 <p>our jobs in virtually any location. Whether it’s conducting research,</p>
<p> updating a spreadsheet, designing a new logo, marketing a product,</p>
<p> or providing customer service, most day-to-day tasks can now be done from the safety of one’s home.</p>
<p> People in many professions have found that they’re able accomplish </p>
 <p>just about anything they can in a regular office.</p>

<p>None of this would have been possible just three to four decades ago,</p>
 <p>because most work relied on expensive, largely immobile equipment that </p>
<p> could not be used at home. While people in some service sectors may not be</p>
 <p>able to work from home, for a good portion of the workforce,</p>
 <p>the incredible digital infrastructure of the internet makes working from home an entirely feasible option now.</p>
 

<p>Mobile networks and devices</p>
<p>Critics often decry the always-on, always-connected nature of modern life.</p>
<p> The mobile phone is typically at the center of these laments. To be sure,</p>
<p> many of us use our mobile devices too frequently or at the wrong times,</p>
 <p>and addiction can be a real problem for some. But the mobile phone</p>
 <p>revolution has provided more societal benefits than costs.</p>
 <p>Simply being able to connect with loved ones, co-workers, </p>
<p> or emergency services from anywhere is an amazing achievement.</p>

<p>But mobile devices offer far more than that. Smartphones have now</p>
 <p>“morphed into the Swiss Army knife of gadgets” that we use as our cameras,</p>
<p> portable music devices, televisions, gaming platforms, mapping and traffic navigation tools,</p>
<p> internet portals, notepads, email and messaging clients, payment tools,</p>
<p> home automation agents, wearable fitness trackers, and even as watches, flashlights,</p>
 <p>compasses, and thermometers. How does one measure the value of having all of </p>
<p> these functions available in one device instead of dozens? It’s difficult to calculate,</p>
<p> but by offering us all those services on one portable platform,</p>
<p> our smartphones have clearly made basic tasks more convenient.</p>
<p>During a time of crisis, having these many capabilities in our pocket,</p>
<p> especially any related to health, becomes even more essential.</p>
<p> Fitness trackers could be made even more useful in a time of pandemic.</p>
<p> For example, if more mobile devices had temperature sensors,</p>
<p> they could help us deal with diseases like COVID-19.</p>

<p>Social media platforms</p>
<p>Social media sites have been under fire for supposedly fueling various social ills.</p>
 <p>Many critics have called for sweeping social media regulation. But the pandemic</p>
 <p>has made clear just how important these platforms are. “For going on nearly half</p>
 <p>a decade now, the tone on tech companies and social media has shifted to one of</p>
<p> suspicion, hostility, grievance, and moral panic,” notes Elizabeth Nolan Brown</p>
<p> of Reason. “But as COVID-19 continues to spread around the world and as many governments</p>
 <p>continue to mishandle things, people are starting to remember why the platforms we </p>
 <p>love to hate are important after all.”</p>

<p>Twitter has become a critical platform for mass dissemination of news and perspectives</p>
<p> about solutions to the crisis. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who previously served as </p>
<p> head of the Food and Drug Administration in the Trump Administration,</p>
<p> has become a sort of public health ombudsman that people look to for</p>
<p> unbiased expert information and critiques of official public responses.</p>
<p> But Gottlieb is just one of countless medical professionals and scientists</p>
<p> who have taken to social media platforms to offer the public direct </p>
 <p>information and advice about the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The result has been an important collective fact-check on government statements and proposed responses.</p>
<p> In a New York Times essay entitled, “When Facebook Is More Trustworthy Than the President,”</p>
<p> Ben Smith noted that, “instead of seeing Chinese-style propaganda, </p>
 <p>many users suddenly found themselves reading urgent, sophisticated observations from public health experts.”</p>

<p>Of course, misinformation and bad advice is always a concern.</p>
 <p>But Pinterest, Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms all took</p>
<p> steps to combat the spreading of gross falsehoods. For the most part,</p>
<p> social media has made a wealth of vital health and community safety</p>
<p> information available to the public with remarkable speed. Even traditional</p>
<p>email and websites have become essential tools for many governments,</p>
<p> which provide the public with constant updates about closures and safety practices.</p>

<p>Video conferencing </p>
<p>Video conferencing may be one of the most obvious and direct innovations that enable social</p>
<p> distancing over extended periods of time. Not only has video conferencing made</p>
<p> it significantly less burdensome for many businesses to continue functioning</p>
<p> with a largely remote workforce, it also provides people with much needed face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p> Long-term social isolation can be quite demoralizing, and while nothing can fully</p>
<p> replace being in the physical presence of others, the ability to see and interact with co-workers,</p>
<p> friends, and family can make this period far more bearable.</p>

<p>In addition, video conferencing platforms allow schools and universities</p>
<p> to continue educating their students virtually while they are not able to meet in an actual classroom.</p>
<p> In fact, the CEO of Zoom, a popular video conferencing platform for educational institutions,</p>
<p> recently announced that he is giving his product away for free to K-12 schools during</p>
<p> this time of disaster. Just twenty years ago, none of this would have been possible,</p>
<p> and students sent home in a time like this would have had a more difficult time </p>
<p> connecting with teachers or other students. Instead, students across the globe </p>
<p> are able to continue on with their education with less disruption.</p>

<p>Online entertainment</p>
<p>Video streaming platforms from Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, Disney, HBO,</p> 
<p>YouTube and many others have given the public an array of viewing </p>
<p>choices and helped usher in a new golden age of television.</p>
 <p>During a time of quarantines, these services became an </p>
<p> essential way for people to find quality entertainment </p>
 <p>without having to go out into public and be in close proximity to others.</p>

<p>Likewise, online games offer a safe social experience in a time of quarantine.</p>
<p> For example, Quiplash is a humorous game that people can play at a distance.</p>
<p> After the players login remotely in their homes they can answer silly questions for points.</p>
<p> It’s good, clean quarantine fun. Of course, there are plenty of more serious</p>
<p> gaming options that allow people to play either with known acquaintances or communities of anonymous individuals.</p>

<p>E-commerce and food delivery services</p>
<p>Some of the newer and more exciting innovations to emerge in the past few years </p>
<p>are e-commerce platforms and still-new food delivery services.</p>
<p> You can now get almost anything delivered directly to your door without having to interact with people.</p>
<p> In fact, for many of these services, you don’t even have to make contact with the delivery driver.</p>
<p> They will just leave the product at your door or front desk.</p>

<p>While these services may seem little more than mere convenience in normal times,</p>
<p> COVID-19 shows us just how important and even lifesaving these services can be</p>
<p> when minimizing human contact is of the utmost importance. </p>
<p> It is no surprise that many of these services have become overwhelmed with demand during the crisis.</p>
<p> For many, particularly the elderly and those with compromised immune systems,</p>
<p> the ability to have much needed products and groceries delivered directly to</p>
<p> their door without the need to physically interact with another person is anything but trivial.</p>

<p>We need tech–and Big Tech–now more than ever</p>
<p>Had the pandemic hit just 30 years ago, none of these technologies would have been at our disposal.</p>
<p> This is not to say that things aren’t bad or that these technologies somehow make everything perfect,</p>
<p> but as difficult as life is today in the midst of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements,</p>
<p> life would have become even more difficult without these platforms, devices, services, and applications.</p>

<p>But what other useful or needed technologies might we have access </p>
<p>to today if not for outdated regulations that hold back innovation?</p>

<p>When politicians and critics call for burdensome regulations on digital</p>
 <p>platforms and services, it is important to think ahead about possible unintended consequences.</p>
<p> For example, in the months just before the pandemic hit, </p>
<p> there was a growing movement afoot to reopen and revise a rule called Section 230,</p>
<p> which established a broad liability shield for online content distributors.</p>
<p> Without these protections, online platforms could be driven out of business by excessive</p>
<p> liability and the threat of costly litigation, which could decimate online activity.</p>
<p> Given what’s happened in recent weeks, we should be thankful that advocates for rolling</p>
<p> back Section 230 protections were not successful.</p>

<p>Other critics were clamoring for “breaking up Big Tech” through sweeping antitrust regulations.</p>
<p> That “techlash” would have hobbled many platforms, especially Google, Facebook,</p>
<p> and Amazon, that Americans are relying on in the midst of the crisis.</p>
<p> But these efforts also have not born fruit, possibly because most Americans use</p>
<p> and benefit from the services these large tech firms provide. Indeed,</p>
<p> even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, most Americans viewed digital</p>
<p> technology in a positive light and expressed gratitude that these devices and platforms were at their disposal.</p>

<p>Finally, before the outbreak, many state and local governments were taking</p>
<p> steps to regulate the sharing or “gig” economy through burdensome labor regulations.</p>
<p> For example, last year California passed a new worker classification</p>
<p> law—Assembly Bill 5 (AB-5)—which made it easier to classify</p>
<p> a gig worker as an employee than as an independent contractor.</p>
<p> Such laws were already starting to hurt gig economy companies and workers in good times.</p>
<p> Now that we need delivery drivers and emergency transit more than ever,</p>
<p> the human cost of regulations like AB-5 is tragically stark.</p>

<p>Permissionless innovation is needed in normal times as well as in times of crisis</p>
<p>The lessons here are clear. No matter how well-intentioned,</p>
<p> we should evaluate laws and regulations based on real-world outcomes.</p>
<p> Proposed or existing regulations like those discussed earlier can undermine the ability of companies,</p>
<p> organizations, and average citizens to innovate rapidly in a time of crisis.</p>

<p>We must never take for granted just how much new technological developments have improved</p>
<p> our lives in meaningful ways. To be sure, the internet, social media,</p>
<p> and digital platforms have created new societal problems and have exacerbated some old ones,</p>
<p> such as hate speech and harassment. But these new technologies have always given us more good than bad.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, it took a crisis to teach us this lesson.</p>

 






















 <h2>* Knowing what is CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19)</h2>
 
  <h3>*what is COVID-19 ?</h3>
     <p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.</p>
	 <p>WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following </p>
	 <p>a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’</p>
	 <p>in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China. </p>
   
  <h3>*what are the symptomps?</h3>
     <p>Fever,Dry cough,Fatigue,Loss of taste or smell,</p>
	 <p>Nasal congestion,Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)</p>
	 <p>Sore throat,Headache,Muscle or joint pain,Diarrhea.</p>
	   
	 <p>and it's symptoms </p>
	   <p>Shortness of breath,Loss of appetite,Confusion,High temperature (above 38 °C).</p>
  
   <h3>*what happens to people who get COVID-19?</h3>
    <p> Among those who develop symptoms, most (about</p>
    <p>  80%) recover from the disease without needing</p>
	<p>	  hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill</p>
	<p>	  and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and</p>
	<p>	  need intensive care.</p>

   <h3>*Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?</h3>
    <p>  Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not,</p>
	<p>  continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.</p>
    <p>  WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, </p>
    <p>  researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of </p>
    <p>  patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of  </p>
    <p>  patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur.</p>
    <p>  These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care</p>

<h3>*Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?</h3>
<p>	Yes. The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of</p>
<p>    vaccination doses administered is updated on a daily basis here. At least 13 different vaccines</p> 
<p>    (across 4 platforms) have been administered. Campaigns have started in 206 economies.</p>
<p>    The Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty vaccine was listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 31 December 2020.</p>
<p>    The SII/Covishield and AstraZeneca/AZD1222 vaccines (developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford and manufactured by </p>
<p>    the Serum Institute of India and SK Bio respectively) were given EUL on 16 February.</p>
<p>    The Janssen/Ad26.COV 2.S developed by Johnson & Johnson, was listed for EUL on 12 March 2021. The Moderna</p>
  <p>  COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA 1273) was listed for EUL on 30 April 2021 and the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was </p>
  <p>  listed for EUL on 7 May 2021. The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological</p>
  <p>  Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG).</p>
  <p>  Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, they must be approved by national regulators,</p>
  <p>  manufactured to exacting standards, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help</p>
  <p>  coordinate key steps in this process, including to facilitate equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19</p>
  <p>  vaccines for the billions of people who will need them. </p>

<h3>*What should i do if i have COVID-19 symptoms?</h3>
<p>        If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline</p>
<p>		for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others</p>
<p>		and monitor your health.</p>
<p>        If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health</p>
<p>		facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right</p>
<p>		health facility.</p>
<p>        If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.</p>
<p>        If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation,</p>
<p>		wear a medical mask while travelling to and from the facility and during medical care.</p>
<p>		Also keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands.</p>
<p>		This applies to adults and children.</p>
